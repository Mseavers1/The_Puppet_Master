// Protagonist wakes up in the throne room and stares at his sister being hold down with knights by her side.
* Ganto
Ugh...
*
My vision slowly clears up revealing the throne room with her highness, Queen Shimabukuro Yu, glaring down towards a person with various guards around them.
Nobles and other individuals stand around her on the sidelines, murmuring loudly to one another.
Upon closer inspection, the person chained up is my sister, Minamoto Makka.
* Ganto
That's right... We...
*
I suddenly remember what happened days before...
We attempted to get rid of Saint Emiko.
Not only did she have the gall to decline my various advancements, but she also insisted that I tried to r*pe her various times.
She just a commoner... Who gives a...
A load voice echos in the room, disturbing my thoughts.
* Yu
Silence!
*
The room becomes quiet with everyone turning their attention to the thrown.
Her highness sits with a menacing glaze.
The King, Shimabukuro Emari, sits in the left throne behind her highness with a emotionless glaze.
Sitting on the right throne behind her highness, the crowned princess, Shimabukuro Mizuki, glares at my sister with her fists clenching the throne's armrests.
* Yu
I have called this audience to announce the punishment for Marchioness Minamoto Makka and her brother, Minamoto Ganto.
First, Minamoto Makka... I can no longer overlook your behavior that you have constantly displayed in both the Royal Academia and among the other Noble families.
You have bullied those underneath you, cheated on your assessments and scores, and attempted to murder Saint Emiko.
For your crimes, I hereby declare your punishment is execution in the form of beheading!
*
After announcing my sister's punishment, Yu slowly raises her right hand and motions to one of the knights at my sister's side.
Makka suddenly bursts into tears.
* Makka
N-no! W-wait! It's not my fault!
That blasted commoner has no reason to stand by the princess's side!
It should have been me! If only that...
*
Yu snaps her right hand, quickening the pace of the knight.
* Makka
No... No! No-No-No!!!
*
The knight quickly pulls out her sword and swings it down onto Makka's head.
Her head flies cleanly and falls in front of me. 
As I stare at her fallen face, my vision distorts.
