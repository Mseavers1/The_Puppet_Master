Set a new text file to me based on the sample file!

* NPC Name
Why are you still here?!
I thought I told you to go look at the sample file!

* REPEAT
* NPC Name

This is a sample file to help remember how the chatbox system works.
Use the * to insert keywords
* [name of NPC] -> Used to highlight who is talking
* END -> Ends the diolouge which allows more text for notes if needed or for branches
